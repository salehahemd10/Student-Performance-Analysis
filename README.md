Students Performance Analysis
Overview
This Jupyter Notebook analyzes student performance data from the "StudentsPerformance.csv" dataset. The dataset contains information about students' demographics, parental education levels, test preparation, and their scores in math, reading, and writing.

Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

gender: Student's gender (male/female)

race/ethnicity: Student's racial/ethnic group (group A-E)

parental level of education: Parent's highest education level

lunch: Type of lunch program (standard/free or reduced)

test preparation course: Whether student completed test prep (none/completed)

math score: Math test score (0-100)

reading score: Reading test score (0-100)

writing score: Writing test score (0-100)

Key Analyses Performed
Data Exploration:

Basic statistics and information about the dataset

Value counts for categorical variables

Cross-tabulations between different variables

Performance Analysis:

Comparison of average scores by gender

Analysis of score distributions

Group comparisons by race/ethnicity and parental education

Visualizations:

Bar charts showing relationships between categorical variables

Comparative analysis of performance across different groups

Key Findings
Female students generally outperform male students in reading and writing

Students with standard lunch programs perform better than those with free/reduced lunch

Higher parental education levels correlate with better student performance

Students who completed test preparation courses tend to score higher
